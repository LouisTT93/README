             ***** ABOUT ME *****
My name is Louis Valentine, I'm a software engineer & on my way to be a full stack developer. I am excited to try to find my place in the IT world. And obviously, I'm excited to learn about how I can contribute with a team & get a higher rating of efficiency on my work.

              **** I’m interested in ****
I am interested in coding in video games, i think that would be a really cool skillset to learn. I also love the idea of working remotely, or from home. I think it would be really cool to collaborate on projhects that deal with payment information, and processing. I think it would be really interesting to see the code that makes money move around. Or maybe an app that can track someones trip and how fast they are going.

            *** I’m currently learning ***
In my bootcamp I'm attending I'm currently working with javascript. I'm learning python on the side in my spare time. I really like some of the things I'm learning i can build with javascript, especially on thew math side of javascript. I'm excited to become more proficient in my craft. I think that makes the world of difference, in regards to work ethic.

          Here is a link to my latest project:
https://louistt93.github.io/se_project_spots/ This responsive web-design for all screen sizes was done with some media queries. The positioning was mostly all flexbox, although the cards were positioned using grid properties. This Project is also got a few well placed javascript components. Thanks for looking over my README and visiting my site. Have a blessed day.
